# dpim-shell
This is a repository of reduced-order models for nonlinear dynamics, combining the DPIM and a 7-parameter shell element. It includes code in both Julia and MATLAB. Julia is used for efficient implementation, while MATLAB offers easier debugging and an efficient solution method for the ROM equations based on the HBM.
